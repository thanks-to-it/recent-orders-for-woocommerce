Display the customer's recent order list on the frontend in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Enhance your WooCommerce store with the **Recent Orders Widget for WooCommerce** plugin, offering dynamic displays of recent customer orders, customizable content, and a personalized shopping experience for your customers.

### ðŸš€ Show Recent Orders on Website Frontend ###

This plugin enables you to display a list of customers' recent orders on the frontend of your WooCommerce store.

You can show recent orders using the "Recent Orders" widget or the `[alg_wc_recent_orders]` shortcode, providing a dynamic view of recent customer activity directly on your site.

### ðŸš€ Customizable Orders Display Limit ###

Configure the number of recent orders to display in the widget, while the default setting shows the five most recent orders, but you can adjust this number to suit your preferences.

This feature allows you to control how much of the recent order history is visible to your customers in a glance.

### ðŸš€ Personalized Section Content ###

Customize the content displayed before the recent orders list. Use available placeholders like `%my_account_url%`, `%orders_url%`, and `%user_display_name%` to add a personalized touch.

For example, greet users by name or provide a link to their account page, enhancing user engagement with a more tailored experience.

### ðŸš€ Detailed Customization for Each Order Row ###

Fine-tune the display for each order in the list with various placeholders like `%order_number%`, `%order_url%`, and `%order_total%`.

You can also control what appears after the list of recent orders. Use placeholders to provide links for further actions, like viewing more orders.

This level of detail ensures that customers can see key information about their recent purchases at a glance, such as order number, date, total, and status.
